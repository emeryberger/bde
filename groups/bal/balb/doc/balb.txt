@PURPOSE: Provide common application-level facilities.

@MNEMONIC: Basic Application Library Basis (balb)

@SEE_ALSO: balm

@DESCRIPTION: The 'balb' package provides support for an assortment of common
 application-level services (e.g., command-line processing).  In particular,
 'balb' includes the following:

: o A mechanism for monitoring and reporting the observable performance of a
:   process.
:
: o Classes for (1) defining commands (as short strings), (2) passing these
:   commands through a pipe-channel to a running process, and (3) registering
:   callback functions to be invoked upon reception of such commands.
:
: o A multi-process performance reporting mechanism and a value-semantic type
:   to represent metrics.  Note that the entire {'balm'} package is dedicated
:   to metrics gathering.
:
: o A mechanism that allows clients to monitor whether a resource is being
:   consumed at a particular rate.
:
: o A mechanism that enables clients to monitor and control the use of a
:   resource such that the peak consumption rate and the sustained consumption
:   rate do not exceed their respective configured limits.
:
: o Generic proctor to automatically reserve and release units from a rate
:   controlling object.
